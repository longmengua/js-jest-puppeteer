# jest with puppeteer

##### Jest
  - introduction
    - is a popular open-source JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook. It is specifically designed for testing JavaScript code, including code written in React, Vue, Angular, and other JavaScript frameworks. Jest aims to provide an easy-to-use and comprehensive testing environment for developers.
  - features and functionalities
    - Zero Configuration
      - Jest comes with sensible defaults and requires minimal configuration to get started. This makes it easy to set up and use in projects.
    - Test Runners
      - Jest provides a test runner that executes test suites and individual test cases. It can run tests in parallel, making the testing process faster.
    - Assertions
      - Jest includes a set of built-in assertion functions that allow you to make assertions about your code's behavior. These assertions check whether the expected conditions are met during testing.
    - Mocking
      - Jest offers powerful mocking capabilities, allowing you to create mock versions of external dependencies, functions, or modules. This is useful for isolating specific parts of your code during testing.
    - Snapshot Testing
      - Jest supports snapshot testing, where you can capture the output of a component or piece of code and compare it against a stored "snapshot." This is particularly useful for ensuring that UI components do not unintentionally change over time.
    - Async Testing
      - Jest makes it easy to test asynchronous code by providing utilities to handle promises, async/await, timers, and more.
    - Code Coverage
      - Jest can generate code coverage reports, showing which parts of your codebase are covered by tests and which are not. This helps identify areas that might need more thorough testing.
    - Watch Mode
      - Jest includes a watch mode that automatically re-runs tests when changes are detected in the source code. This feature is helpful for a more iterative development and testing process.
    - Plugins and Extensions
      - Jest supports a variety of plugins and extensions to enhance its functionality, such as integration with popular libraries like Enzyme for React component testing.
    - Community and Ecosystem
      - Jest has a large and active community, which means you can find a wealth of resources, tutorials, and third-party extensions to help you use Jest effectively.


##### Puppeteer
  - introduction
    - Puppeteer is a Node.js library developed by Google's Chrome team. It provides a high-level API that allows you to control headless versions of the Google Chrome or Chromium web browsers. A "headless" browser is a browser that can be run in a non-graphical environment, meaning it doesn't show a user interface but can still perform web-related tasks.
  - features and functionalities
    - Page Manipulation
      - Puppeteer allows you to navigate to web pages, fill out forms, click buttons, interact with elements, and perform other actions as if you were interacting with a real web browser.
    - Screenshots and PDF Generation
      - Puppeteer can capture screenshots of web pages and generate PDFs from them. This is useful for creating visual reports or for capturing the state of a web page at a particular moment.
    - Web Scraping
      - Puppeteer can be used to scrape data from websites by programmatically navigating through pages and extracting information from the page's DOM.
    - Automated Testing:
      - Puppeteer is often used for automated testing of web applications. It can simulate user interactions and test how the application responds.
    - Performance Testing
      - Puppeteer can measure the performance of web pages by recording and analyzing network activities, rendering times, and other metrics.
    - SEO Testing
      - Puppeteer can be used to test how search engines crawl and render web pages, which is important for search engine optimization (SEO) purposes.
    - Browser Simulation
      - Puppeteer can simulate user behavior on web pages, which is valuable for various use cases, including load testing and analyzing user journeys.
    - Headless Mode
      - Puppeteer's ability to run in headless mode (without a graphical user interface) is particularly useful for server-side applications or automated tasks.
